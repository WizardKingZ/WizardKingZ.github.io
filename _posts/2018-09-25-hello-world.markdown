The idea behind the Box-Muller transform is to imagine two independent samples $$X, Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ plotted in the Cartesian plane, and then represent these points as polar coordinates. Recall, to transform to polar, we need the distance $$R$$ between $$(X,Y)$$ and the origin along with $$\theta$$, the angle this line segment makes with the x-axis.
